## [Unreleased]

### Features

- Add prompts CLI command with list and install subcommands
  - `mcp-tasks prompts list` - List all available built-in prompts with type information
  - `mcp-tasks prompts install <prompt1> [prompt2]...` - Install specific prompts to local directories
  - Support for multiple output formats (human, json, edn) via --format flag
  - Category prompts install to .mcp-tasks/category-prompts/
  - Workflow prompts install to .mcp-tasks/prompt-overrides/
  - Replaces deprecated --list-prompts and --install-prompts server flags

### Changed

- Replaced clojure.data.json with cheshire.core for babashka compatibility
  - cheshire.core is built into babashka (no additional dependency needed)
  - Also works seamlessly in JVM Clojure when added to deps.edn
  - API-compatible with clojure.data.json for our usage (read-str with :key-fn, write-str)
  - Enables CLI to run under babashka for ~40x faster startup times
