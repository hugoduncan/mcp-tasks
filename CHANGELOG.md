## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- Replaced clojure.data.json with cheshire.core for babashka compatibility
  - cheshire.core is built into babashka (no additional dependency needed)
  - Also works seamlessly in JVM Clojure when added to deps.edn
  - API-compatible with clojure.data.json for our usage (read-str with :key-fn, write-str)
  - Enables CLI to run under babashka for ~40x faster startup times
