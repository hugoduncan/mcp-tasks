## Branch Management

1. Before starting task execution:
   - Check if currently on a branch named `<story-name>`
   - If not, checkout the default branch, ensure it's up to date with
     origin, then create the `<story-name>` branch

2. After task completion:
   - Remain on the `<story-name>` branch for the next task
   - Do not merge or push automatically
