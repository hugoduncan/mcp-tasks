Review the implementation of a story against its requirements and code quality standards.

Parse the arguments: $ARGUMENTS
- The first word/token is the story name
- Everything after is additional context to consider when reviewing

## Process

1. Read the story file from `.mcp-tasks/story/stories/<story-name>.md`
   - If the file doesn't exist, inform the user and stop

2. Analyze the current branch against the description of the story:
   - Does the code implement the story correctly?
   - Does it have extra functionality that was not requested?

3. Analyze the quality of the code in the implementation:
   - Is it as simple as possible?
   - Is the code DRY?
   - Is the naming used consistent?
   - Check error handling, input validation, and edge cases

4. Analyze the structure of the code:
   - Separation of concerns
   - Single responsibility

5. Report findings:
   - List issues clearly and numbered (e.g., "1. Add error handling...", "2. Improve test coverage...")
   - Suggest improvements in a numbered list format

6. Interactive task creation from suggestions:
   - After presenting all findings and suggestions, ask the user:
     "Would you like to create story tasks for any of these suggestions? (enter numbers separated by commas, e.g., '1,3' or 'all' for all suggestions, or 'none' to skip)"

   - If user selects suggestions:
     a) For each selected suggestion:
        - Present the suggestion text
        - Ask: "Task description (press Enter to use suggestion as-is, or type custom description):"
        - If user provides text, use it; otherwise use the original suggestion text
        - Ask: "Category (simple/medium/large) [default: medium]:"
        - Validate category input; if invalid, re-prompt
        - If user just presses Enter, use "medium"

     b) After collecting all task details, use the `add-task` tool for each task:
        - Use the `add-task` tool with these parameters:
          - `category`: the selected category (simple/medium/large)
          - `task-text`: "STORY: <story-name> - <task description>"
          - `story-name`: the story name from step 1
          - `prepend`: false (to append tasks)

        Example:
        ```
        add-task(
          category="medium",
          task-text="STORY: my-story - Add error handling for edge cases",
          story-name="my-story",
          prepend=false
        )
        ```

     c) Confirm to user:
        "âœ“ Added N task(s) to <story-name>-tasks.md:"
        List each task with its category in a bullet format

   - If user selects 'none' or provides no selections, skip task creation

## Notes

- All suggestions should be numbered from the start to make selection easy
- Task descriptions can be refined by the user or used verbatim from suggestions
- Categories help route tasks to appropriate execution workflows
- The `add-task` tool automatically handles file creation, formatting, and task preservation
