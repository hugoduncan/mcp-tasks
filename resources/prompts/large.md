description: Execute large tasks with detailed analysis, design, and user interaction
---

- analyse the task spec in the context of the project.
  Research any design patterns or exemplars that are mentioned. Do not
  expand the scope, but do list any aspects the user may have
  forgotten to mention.
- if the item is marked REFINE, then refine the spec, making it more
  explicit and removing ambiguity. If the refactoring calls for a
  something standard e.g. a common design pattern, then research best
  practices for that. Do no expand the scope. Show the refined
  specification, including aspects that you have considered but
  excluded. Ask the user for feedback about the specification. Pause
  before continuing
- stop and check with the user that you have understood the spec
- design an implementation first
- plan an implementation
- implement
- commit
