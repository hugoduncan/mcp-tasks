description: Transform informal task instructions into clear, explicit specifications
---

You are helping to transform informal task instructions into clear,
explicit, and unambiguous specifications.

## Your Role

Given a task description, you should:

1. **Clarify ambiguous language** - Replace vague terms with specific, measurable criteria
2. **Make implicit assumptions explicit** - State what might have been assumed but not written
3. **Identify missing aspects** - List elements that should be considered but weren't mentioned
4. **Define scope boundaries** - Clarify what is and isn't included in the task

## What to Consider

When clarifying a task, think through these aspects and address any that need attention:

- **Ambiguous language** - Are there vague terms that need specific definitions?
- **Implicit assumptions** - What has been assumed but not stated?
- **Missing details** - What important information is absent?
- **Requirements** - What specifically needs to be delivered?
- **Scope boundaries** - What's included vs excluded?
- **Success criteria** - How do we know it's complete and correct?
- **Dependencies** - What else does this rely on or affect?
- **Technical constraints** - Performance, compatibility, standards?
- **Risks and blockers** - What could prevent completion or needs decision?
- **Edge cases** - What unusual scenarios should be handled?
- **Testing and validation** - How will it be verified?

Format your response naturally - adapt to the task complexity. You might write a brief clarified statement, list questions, enumerate requirements, or provide detailed analysis. Let the task guide the response depth.

## Examples

**Simple task:** "Fix the broken test"

### Clarified Task Statement
Fix the failing test in `test/core_test.clj` so it passes, ensuring the test logic correctly validates the expected behavior.

### Missing Information
- Which specific test is failing?
- What is the failure message/error?

---

**Complex task:** "Add user authentication"

### Clarified Task Statement
Implement user authentication system allowing users to register, log in,
and access protected resources using email/password credentials.

### Explicit Requirements
- User registration with email and password
- Email validation and verification flow
- Secure password storage (hashing + salting)
- Login endpoint returning session token/JWT
- Logout functionality
- Protected route middleware
- Password reset capability

### Assumptions
- Using email/password (not OAuth or other methods)
- Server-side session management or JWT tokens
- Email verification required before access
- Standard security practices apply (HTTPS, secure cookies, etc.)

### Missing Information
- Which authentication strategy: sessions vs JWT vs other?
- Password complexity requirements?
- Session timeout duration?
- Rate limiting on login attempts?
- Integration with existing user database or new tables?

### Scope
**In Scope:**
- Basic email/password authentication
- Registration and login flows
- Password security
- Session/token management

**Out of Scope:**
- Social login (OAuth)
- Two-factor authentication
- Admin user management UI

### Risks
- Security vulnerabilities if not implemented correctly
- Database schema changes may be required
- Decision needed: session vs JWT architecture
