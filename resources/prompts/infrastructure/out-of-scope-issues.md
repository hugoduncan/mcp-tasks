For each out-of-scope issue you discovered while executing the task,
create a task describing the issue. Use `add-task`, link with
`:discovered-during` relation via `update-task`.

**Capture:** Unrelated bugs, technical debt, missing tests,
documentation gaps. **Don't capture:** In-scope issues, direct blockers,
minor fixes.
